abstract = {Abstract Multiagent robotics affords the opportunity to solve problems more efficiently and effectively than any single agent could achieve. Nonetheless, communication bottlenecks between agents pose potentially serious drawbacks in coordinated behavior. In this research, we demonstrate the efficiency of multiagent schema-based navigation for object retrieval. Primitive motor behaviors are specified for each of the individual robotic agents, which produce safe task-achieving action in an unstructured environment. When implemented over several identical units, retrieval is facilitated in the absence of interagent communication as evidenced by spontaneous recruitment of several agents to accomplish a task. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate these effects. Extensions to other task-achieving behaviors are also feasible.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fiducial marker system specially appropriated for camera pose estimation in applications such as augmented reality and robot localization. Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.}
